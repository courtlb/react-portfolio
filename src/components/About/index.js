            Hello! My name is Courtney, and I am a full-stack web developer located in Austin, Texas. 
            I am interested in leveraging my professional engineering background to create responsive web applications with a focus on seamless user interface. 
            I recently graduated from the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp, improving my skills in JavaScript, SQL, and the MERN stack. 
            I am passionate about breaking down large problems into smaller, manageable pieces, and collaborating with teammates to deliver a timely and impactful MVP. 
            Iâ€™m eager to leverage my experience on fast-paced, cross-functional teams to tackle exciting web development projects.            </p>
